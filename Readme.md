This repo contains stubs for various programming languages and frameworks.

This serves as notes for me on how to set up projects in different languages and frameworks, and as smoke tests for development environments.

The assumption is that the environment has been set up to have the basic tools
to allow different projects to manage different versions of the core language toolchain (rbenv, pyenv, nvm, etc).

For remote VMs on cloud services, my jh-infrastructure folder sets up dev machines compatible with these stubs.

For local Mac, this repo lists the brew packages I use to set up a development environment

For programming against web frameworks, the web repo deploys these various stub applications to my web VM, or they can be run against localhost just with this repo.

For programming against various services such as databases the web repo also deploys these so the relevant stubs can work against them.
